# Sales_Dashboard_Project

As part of my career as a data analyst, I'm thrilled to announce that I recently finished my first Power BI Sales Dashboard (practice assignment)!. This project required me to use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) procedures to turn raw, unstructured data into usable insights, which was both difficult and satisfying.
What I discovered is that:

  Raw data should be cleaned and prepared for analysis.

  Applying the reliable graphical capabilities of Power BI to produce a fascinating and dynamic display.

  Finding the most important sales trends and KPIs that influence business choices.

  I'm excited to take on more tasks, pick up new skills, and advance in the data analytics industry.
